# Convert CFG grammar to CNF grammar and applying CKY for parsing a sentence
This is a small project in my NLP class that supports the following features:
- Converting CFG grammar to CNF grammar.
- Using CKY algorithm to parse a sentence based on the CNF grammar.

Before running the jupyter notebook file, please make sure to create `output` folder beforehand if needed.
